This module was written for processing of GO "lego" models, authored using the Noctua tool

In order to do this, it incorporates the beginnings of a generic OWL
ontology library. Note that for fully-fledged OWL processing you will
want to use jython + OWLAPI. This library is intended to cover roughly
the obo-basic subset of an ontology, as typically used in
bioinformatics applications.

The repo may potentially split: the OWL part should be relatively generic

PACKAGE NAMES, APIS ETC ALL SUBJECT TO CHANGE!!
