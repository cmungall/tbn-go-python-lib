Library for working with OWL, with an emphasis on the subset of OWL
required by users of GO and OBO ontologies, plus convenience methods.

Currently what is supported is:

 * The "OBO Basic" subset of OWL
 * Individuals and connections between them (LEGO/Noctua models)

It is not intended for performing advanced processing of all OWL axiom
types. For that we recommend:

 * jython + the OWLAPI. See LINK TO DAVID'S EXAMPLES HERE
 * FuXi

To see the capabilities of this library, see the tests/ directory

PACKAGE NAMES, APIS ETC ALL SUBJECT TO CHANGE!!
